# Row Counter

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
### Description:
This basic counter app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to increment a counter and save entries. With a clean and intuitive user interface, users can easily interact with the app to track counts and save their entries for reference. Upon clicking the "SAVE" button, the current count is displayed, and the counter resets to zero for the next entry.


Happy Coding!
